hey, i'm signalnerve.

software developer + musician living in austin, tx

what i'm working on:

[cloudflare workers](https://workers.dev) — a super fast edge serverless platform. as the developer advocate i build a lot of open-source projects and write about what you can do with the platform. things like [workers-graphql-server](https://github.com/signalnerve/workers-graphql-server) and [wrangler-action](https://github.com/signalnerve/workers-graphql-server).

[bytesized code](https://www.bytesized.xyz) is a [youtube channel](https://www.bytesized.xyz/yt) and community ([join our discord!](https://www.bytesized.xyz/discord)) for software developers. we put on a bunch of remote tech conferences that you can [check out and rewatch on our website](https://www.bytesized.xyz/conferences).

i'm always hacking on a couple different things, and i'm around if you ever have questions about workers or general programming stuff. say hi on discord – signalnerve#0001.
