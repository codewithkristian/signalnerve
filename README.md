Hey, I'm @signalnerve

I'm a software engineer & writer based in ATX.

I help people build newsletters. Newsletter Bootcamp is my email course about starting & growing your newsletter. I also moderate Mailing List Hackers, a group for newsletter builders.

I'm a developer advocate for Cloudflare Workers. I'm exploring how serverless & edge computing can shift how we architect applications for the web.

My main focus is Bytesized: a newsletter exploring important ideas for developers. You can sign up for it at bytesized.xyz.
